# InStock

InStock was a group project that took place over a week long sprint. The goal was to create a full-stack application that allowed a user to manage a directory of warehouses and their corresponding inventories. The user can add a new warehouse, delete a warehouse, delete items for a warehouse, and add items to a warehouse. My goal was to recreate the project using functional components and translating the project over to TypeScript.
